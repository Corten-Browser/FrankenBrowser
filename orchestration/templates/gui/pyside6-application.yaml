acceptance_criteria:
  - "Main window with menu bar and status bar"
  - "Multiple dialog types (file open, message box, custom)"
  - "Signals and slots for event handling"
  - "Layouts (QVBoxLayout, QHBoxLayout, QGridLayout)"
  - "Custom widgets with painting and event handling"
  - "Application settings persistence (QSettings)"
  - "Performance: Window opens in < 500ms"

test_strategy:
  unit_tests:
    - "Widget creation and initialization"
    - "Signal emission and slot connection"
    - "Layout calculations"
    - "Settings save/load"
  integration_tests:
    - "Full application startup and shutdown"
    - "Dialog workflows (open → interact → close)"
    - "Menu action handling"
  gui_tests:
    - "Qt Test framework (QTest)"
    - "Automated UI testing (mouse clicks, keyboard input)"
  benchmarks:
    - "Application startup time"
    - "UI responsiveness (frame rate)"

implementation_hints:
  - "Use Qt Designer for complex layouts (generate .ui files)"
  - "Use signals/slots for loose coupling"
  - "QMainWindow for main app window (built-in menu/toolbar/status)"
  - "QDialog for modal dialogs, QWidget for embedded widgets"
  - "Store settings with QSettings (cross-platform)"
  - "Use Qt Style Sheets (QSS) for custom styling (CSS-like)"
  - "Use Qt Resource System (.qrc) for bundling assets"

common_pitfalls:
  - issue: "UI freezing during long operations"
    solution: "Use QThread or QThreadPool for background tasks"
  - issue: "Memory leaks from parent-child relationships"
    solution: "Qt handles cleanup if parent set correctly"
  - issue: "Signals not triggering"
    solution: "Check signal/slot signatures match exactly"
  - issue: "Layouts not resizing properly"
    solution: "Set size policies, use stretch factors"
  - issue: "Application doesn't remember window size/position"
    solution: "Save/restore geometry in QSettings"
